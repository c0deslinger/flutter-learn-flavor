This project is a from my tutorial:

- [Flutter iOS — Setup Flavors with different Firebase Config](https://ahmedyusuf.medium.com/setup-flavors-in-ios-flutter-with-different-firebase-config-43c4c4823e6b)
- [Flutter Android — Setup flavor with different Firebase Config](https://ahmedyusuf.medium.com/how-to-build-flavor-in-flutter-android-with-different-firebase-config-96b259e5572e)
